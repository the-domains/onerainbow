I am an artist.  Art and creativity are primal means of self-definition for me.  The human experience is by far the most multifaceted aspect of existence, and of course the most confusing!  Art helps bring clarity to our invisibe selves, our souls, and has the potential to assist in the process of aligning our personal soul with the suprapersonal spirit of the universe.

My art seeks to accentuate and bring definite form to some of the most abstract concepts we deal with as humans - life, love, spirit, relationships, and self. I choose to make art that serves the mission of radical Self-revaltion through creativity and imagination.
